# Problem Statement

- As someone who goes to fitness classes on a regular basis, I am exposed to different workouts during the classes. There is a tendency of me not remembering some of the workouts that I did previously. Hence, it has resulted me in having to ask the trainer for that workouts whenever I wish to revisit them.

# Problem Solution

- Hence, I have decided to develop a telegram bot whereby the trainer is able to record down the daily workout in the database (i.e. airtable), and as such, forgetful member like me is able to retrieve them with the simple command from the telegram bot

# User Story

- As a owner/trainer of the gym, I should be able to able to key in the data into the database so that my members can revisit them anytime they want
- As a user, I should be able to pull the workouts on a particular date via telegram command (i.e. view)
- (Stretch Goal) As a trainer/owner, I should be able to get my feedback from my member via the user experience level
- (Stretch Goal) As a user, I should be able to key my comfort level for my trainer/owner to feedback
